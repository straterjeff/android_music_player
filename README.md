## 🎵 **Testing with Sample Music**

### ADB Setup for File Transfer

To test jPod with your own music files, you'll need **ADB (Android Debug Bridge)** to transfer MP3s to the emulator or device.

#### Installing ADB

**On macOS (recommended):**
```bash
# Install via Homebrew
brew install android-platform-tools
```

**On Windows:**
1. Download [Android Platform Tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools)
2. Extract and add to your system PATH
3. Or use Android Studio's built-in ADB: `~/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/`

**On Linux:**
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install android-tools-adb

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S android-tools
```

#### Verify ADB Installation
```bash
adb version
# Should show: Android Debug Bridge version X.X.X
```

### Managing Music in jPod

**jPod uses a dedicated, organized folder structure for reliable music discovery and management.**

#### Prerequisites
1. **ADB installed and working** (see ADB Installation section above)
2. **Device/emulator connected** via ADB
3. **Music files organized locally** in the correct structure

#### Required Folder Structure

**Local computer reference structure:**
```
~/jPod/
├── [Artist Name]/
│   ├── [Album 1]/
│   │   ├── 01 - Track One.mp3
│   │   ├── 02 - Track Two.mp3
│   │   └── 03 - Track Three.m4a
│   ├── [Album 2 - EP]/
│   │   ├── 01 - EP Track.m4a
│   │   └── 02 - EP Track Two.m4a
│   └── [Singles Collection]/
│       ├── Single Song.mp3
│       └── Another Single.m4a
└── [Another Artist]/
    ├── [Their Album]/
    │   ├── track1.mp3
    │   └── track2.m4a
    └── [Their EP]/
        └── ep_track.m4a
```

**Android device target structure:**
```
/sdcard/Music/jPod/
├── [Artist Name]/
│   ├── [Album 1]/
│   │   ├── 01 - Track One.mp3
│   │   ├── 02 - Track Two.mp3
│   │   └── 03 - Track Three.m4a
│   ├── [Album 2 - EP]/
│   │   ├── 01 - EP Track.m4a
│   │   └── 02 - EP Track Two.m4a
│   └── [Singles Collection]/
│       ├── Single Song.mp3
│       └── Another Single.m4a
└── [Another Artist]/
    ├── [Their Album]/
    │   ├── track1.mp3
    │   └── track2.m4a
    └── [Their EP]/
        └── ep_track.m4a
```

#### Why Hierarchical Artist/Album Structure?

The **Artist/Album** folder structure provides several important benefits:
- **📚 Proper Album Grouping:** Albums with featured artists or collaborations appear as unified entities (no duplicate albums)
- **🎵 Metadata Precedence:** Album metadata takes priority over individual track artists for organization
- **📁 Clean Organization:** Music is logically organized and easy to browse by both artist and album
- **🔍 Enhanced Discoverability:** Makes it easier to find specific albums and maintain large collections
- **🎯 Album Cohesion:** Tracks from the same album stay together regardless of featuring different artists

#### Supported Audio Formats
- **MP3** (.mp3) - Recommended for compatibility
- **M4A/AAC** (.m4a) - Excellent quality, includes album art
- **FLAC** (.flac) - Lossless quality
- **WAV** (.wav) - Uncompressed
- **OGG Vorbis** (.ogg) - Open source
- **WMA** (.wma) - Windows Media Audio

#### Step-by-Step Music Transfer Process

#### 1. Check Connected Devices
```bash
adb devices
# Should show your emulator or device listed
# Example output:
# emulator-5554   device
# ABC123DEF456    device  (physical device)
```

#### 2. Organize Music Files Locally
Create the proper hierarchical structure on your computer:
```bash
# Create local jPod directory (recommended location)
mkdir -p ~/jPod

# Create artist and album directories
mkdir -p ~/jPod/"Dave Hause"/"Kick"
mkdir -p ~/jPod/"Dave Hause"/"Paddy - EP"  
mkdir -p ~/jPod/"Dave Hause"/"Patty - EP"
mkdir -p ~/jPod/"Fantastic Cat"/"The Very Best of Fantastic Cat"

# Copy your music files into appropriate Artist/Album folders
# Maintain the hierarchical Artist/Album structure for proper organization
```

#### 3. Transfer Music to Device
```bash
# Transfer entire collection (recommended - maintains Artist/Album hierarchy):
adb push ~/jPod/ /sdcard/Music/

# Multiple devices - specify device ID:
# Emulator:
adb -s emulator-5554 push ~/jPod/ /sdcard/Music/

# Physical device (replace ABC123DEF456 with your device ID):
adb -s ABC123DEF456 push ~/jPod/ /sdcard/Music/

# Transfer single artist (maintains album structure):
adb -s emulator-5554 push ~/jPod/"Dave Hause"/ /sdcard/Music/jPod/"Dave Hause"/

# Transfer single album:
adb -s emulator-5554 push ~/jPod/"Dave Hause"/"Kick"/ /sdcard/Music/jPod/"Dave Hause"/"Kick"/
```

#### 4. Trigger Media Scanner (Critical Step)
Android's MediaStore must be updated to index the new files:
```bash
# Single device:
adb shell am broadcast -a android.intent.action.MEDIA_SCANNER_SCAN_FILE -d file:///sdcard/Music/jPod

# Multiple devices:
adb -s emulator-5554 shell am broadcast -a android.intent.action.MEDIA_SCANNER_SCAN_FILE -d file:///sdcard/Music/jPod
adb -s ABC123DEF456 shell am broadcast -a android.intent.action.MEDIA_SCANNER_SCAN_FILE -d file:///sdcard/Music/jPod
```

#### 5. Restart jPod App
```bash
# Force stop app to clear any cached music data:
adb shell am force-stop com.example.android_music_player

# Launch jPod:
adb shell am start -n com.example.android_music_player/.MainActivity
```

#### Troubleshooting Common Issues

##### "No song found" Error
1. **Check folder structure:** Verify files are in `/sdcard/Music/jPod/[Artist]/`
2. **Trigger media scan:** Run the MediaStore broadcast command
3. **Check file permissions:** Files must be readable by MediaStore
4. **Restart app:** Force-stop and restart jPod

##### Duplicate Songs Appearing
If you see duplicate versions of the same song (e.g., both MP3 and M4A):
```bash
# List duplicates:
adb shell 'find /sdcard/Music/jPod -name "*Song Title*"'

# Remove unwanted format (keep highest quality):
adb shell 'rm "/sdcard/Music/jPod/Artist/Song Title.mp3"'  # Remove MP3, keep M4A
# OR
adb shell 'rm "/sdcard/Music/jPod/Artist/Song Title.m4a"'  # Remove M4A, keep MP3

# Trigger rescan after cleanup:
adb shell am broadcast -a android.intent.action.MEDIA_SCANNER_SCAN_FILE -d file:///sdcard/Music/jPod
```

##### Verify Transfer Success
```bash
# Check directory structure:
adb shell 'find /sdcard/Music/jPod -type d | sort'

# Count files per artist:
adb shell 'ls /sdcard/Music/jPod/"Artist Name"/ | wc -l'

# List specific files:
adb shell 'ls /sdcard/Music/jPod/"Artist Name"/'
```

#### Advanced: Multiple Device Management
For managing multiple devices simultaneously:
```bash
# Get all connected device IDs:
adb devices | grep -v "List" | awk '{print $1}' > device_list.txt

# Transfer to all devices (bash script):
while read device; do
  echo "Transferring to $device..."
  adb -s "$device" push ~/jPod/. /sdcard/Music/jPod/
  adb -s "$device" shell am broadcast -a android.intent.action.MEDIA_SCANNER_SCAN_FILE -d file:///sdcard/Music/jPod
done < device_list.txt
```

#### Future: Automated Music Management
*Note: This is planned for future development*

The current manual ADB process will eventually be replaced with automated tools:
- **Desktop app** for drag-and-drop music management
- **Automated download scripts** for acquiring and organizing music
- **Batch processing** for format conversion and metadata cleanup  
- **Device synchronization** across multiple Android devices
- **Music library backup** and restoration tools

The foundation is in place with the standardized folder structure and reliable transfer process documented above.

#### 5. Install and Test jPod
```bash
# Install the app
./gradlew installDebug

# Launch jPod and grant permissions when prompted
# Your music files should appear automatically!
```

### jPod Music Directory Structure
**jPod uses a dedicated folder for clean, reliable music discovery.** Only music in the jPod folder will appear in the app:

```
/sdcard/Music/jPod/
├── [Artist Name]/
│   ├── 01 Song Name.mp3
│   ├── 02 Another Song.m4a
│   └── ... (more songs by this artist)
├── [Another Artist]/
│   ├── 01 Track Name.mp3
│   └── ... (more songs by this artist)
└── [More Artists]/
```

**Benefits of jPod Folder:**
- ✅ **Clean Discovery**: Only your curated music appears (no system sounds, notifications, etc.)
- ✅ **Future-Proof**: Scales to 1000+ artists without performance issues  
- ✅ **Simple Management**: Easy to organize and transfer music collections
