### Building APK
```bash
# Debug APK
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Release APK (requires signing)
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

## üéµ **Testing with Sample Music**

### ADB Setup for File Transfer

To test jPod with your own music files, you'll need **ADB (Android Debug Bridge)** to transfer MP3s to the emulator or device.

#### Installing ADB

**On macOS (recommended):**
```bash
# Install via Homebrew
brew install android-platform-tools
```

**On Windows:**
1. Download [Android Platform Tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools)
2. Extract and add to your system PATH
3. Or use Android Studio's built-in ADB: `~/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/`

**On Linux:**
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install android-tools-adb

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S android-tools
```

#### Verify ADB Installation
```bash
adb version
# Should show: Android Debug Bridge version X.X.X
```

### Transferring Music Files

#### 1. Check Connected Devices
```bash
adb devices
# Should show your emulator or device listed
```

#### 2. Transfer Your Music Files
```bash
# Extract your music files locally first
unzip your_music.zip -d ~/jPod_test_music/

# Transfer to artist-specific directory in Music folder (current proven approach)
adb push ~/jPod_test_music/"Artist Name - Album Name"/ /sdcard/Music/"Artist Name"/

# For multiple devices (emulator + physical device):
# Emulator:
adb -s emulator-5554 push ~/jPod_test_music/"Artist Name - Album Name"/ /sdcard/Music/"Artist Name"/

# Physical device (replace DEVICE_ID with your device ID from 'adb devices'):
adb -s DEVICE_ID push ~/jPod_test_music/"Artist Name - Album Name"/ /sdcard/Music/"Artist Name"/
```

#### 3. Trigger Media Scanner
After transferring files, trigger Android's media scanner to detect them:
```bash
# Clear MediaStore cache for reliable indexing (recommended)
adb shell pm clear com.android.providers.media

# Scan artist directory  
adb shell am broadcast -a android.intent.action.MEDIA_SCANNER_SCAN_FILE -d file:///storage/emulated/0/Music/"Artist Name"

# For multiple devices:
adb -s emulator-5554 shell am broadcast -a android.intent.action.MEDIA_SCANNER_SCAN_FILE -d file:///storage/emulated/0/Music/"Artist Name"
adb -s DEVICE_ID shell am broadcast -a android.intent.action.MEDIA_SCANNER_SCAN_FILE -d file:///storage/emulated/0/Music/"Artist Name"
```

#### 5. Install and Test jPod
```bash
# Install the app
./gradlew installDebug

# Launch jPod and grant permissions when prompted
# Your music files should appear automatically!
```

### jPod Music Directory Structure
**jPod uses artist-specific directories within the Music folder** for reliable MediaStore compatibility:

```
/sdcard/Music/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dave Hause/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 01 A Knife In The Mud.mp3
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 02 Cellmates.mp3
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 03 Look Alive.mp3
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (more songs)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [Future Artist]/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [Artist songs]
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [System retains other app audio in separate directories]
```

**Current working structure (proven on multiple devices):**
```bash
# Transfer music using ADB
adb push /path/to/music/ /sdcard/Music/[ArtistName]/

# Force MediaStore to recognize files as music
adb shell am broadcast -a android.intent.action.MEDIA_SCANNER_SCAN_FILE -d file:///storage/emulated/0/Music/[ArtistName]
```

**Benefits of this structure:**
- ‚úÖ **Guaranteed MediaStore compatibility**: Works reliably across different Android versions
- ‚úÖ **Clean artist-based filtering**: jPod shows only specified artists, not system audio
- ‚úÖ **Simple management**: Easy to add new artists by creating new directories
- ‚úÖ **Proven stability**: Battle-tested on both emulator and physical devices

### Testing Features
Once music is loaded, test these jPod capabilities:
- ‚úÖ **Playback Controls**: Play, pause, skip, seek
- ‚úÖ **Categories**: Browse by Artist, Album, Genre  
- ‚úÖ **Search**: Find songs by title, artist, album
- ‚úÖ **Playlists**: Create and manage custom playlists
- ‚úÖ **Favorites**: Star/unstar songs
- ‚úÖ **Recently Played**: Check playback history

### Troubleshooting
- **No music appears**: Check permissions and trigger media scanner
- **ADB not found**: Ensure platform-tools are in your PATH
- **Device not detected**: Enable USB Debugging on physical devices
- **Transfer fails**: Check available storage space on device

## üìã **Permissions Required**

The app requires the following permissions:

### Storage Permissions
- **READ_MEDIA_AUDIO** (Android 13+) - Access audio files
- **READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE** (Android 12 and below) - Legacy storage access

### Media Playback
- **FOREGROUND_SERVICE** - Background music playback
- **FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PLAYBACK** - Media-specific foreground service
- **WAKE_LOCK** - Prevent device sleep during playback

## üéØ **Usage Instructions**

- **`BrowseScreen.kt`** - Category browsing interface
- **`PlaylistScreen.kt`** - Playlist management interface
- **Reusable components** for songs, categories, and controls

### Business Logic
- **`MusicPlayerViewModel.kt`** - State management and business logic
- **`MusicService.kt`** - Background audio playbook with Media3

### Key Features Implementation
- **State Management**: StateFlow for reactive UI updates
- **Media Session**: Integration with system media controls
- **Persistence**: JSON serialization for playlist storage
- **Performance**: Lazy loading and efficient list rendering
